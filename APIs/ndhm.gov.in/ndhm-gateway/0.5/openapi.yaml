        This API is called by HIP/HIUs to confirm authentication of users. The
        transactionId returned by the previous callback API /users/auth/on-init
        must be sent. If Authentication is successful the callback API will send
        an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only
        **credential.authCode** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
          1. demographic details are only required for  demographic auth as of now. 
          2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is DEMOGRAPHICS. Usually for demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in User Account.
          3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates. 
          4. credential.authCode is required for other MEDIATED authentication like MOBILE_OTP, AADHAAR_OTP.

        can be *mediated* or *direct*. For mediated authentication modes, HIP or

        info via subsequent API call to /auth/confirm. for direct authentication
        case, CM will notify requester through/users/auth/notify API. 

          1. **auth.mode** conveys whats the mode of authentication is, and what is expected from HIP/HIU in the subsequent /auth/confirm API call. Possible values 
              1. MOBILE_OTP - auth via OTP to registered mobile. Mediated. 
              2. AADHAAR_OTP - auth initiated with Aadhaar with OTP. Mediated.

              4. DIRECT - for authentication directly with the patient. e.g. Mobile App, SMS. In this case, the HIP/HIU is not expected to call subsequent /auth/confirm call. CM will do direct authentication with the User (e.g. Mobile App, SMS etc) and will notify requester

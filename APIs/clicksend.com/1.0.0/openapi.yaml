    This is the official API documentation for ClickSend.com


    Below you will find a current list of the available methods for clicksend.


    **NOTE**: You will need to create a free account to use the API.


    You can

    [**Register Here**](https://dashboard.clicksend.com/#/signup/step1/).


    # API URL


    The API should always be accessed over SSL.


    Base URL: `https://rest.clicksend.com/v3/`


    # Authentication


    Basic HTTP authentication should be used in the header.


    **Either:**


    `username`: Your API username


    `password`: Your API key


    ```

    You can get your API credentials by clicking 'API Credentials' on the top
    right of the dashboard.

    ```


    **OR**


    `username`: Your account username


    `password`: Your account password


    ```

    These are the same credentials that you use to login to the dashboard.

    ```


    ### Authorization Header


    The Authorization header is constructed as follows:

    1. Username and password are combined into a string `username:password`

    1. The resulting string is then encoded using Base64 encoding

    1. The authorization method and a space i.e. "Basic " is then put before the
    encoded string.


    For example, if the user uses `Aladdin` as the username and `open sesame` as
    the password then the header is formed as follows:


    `Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`


    ### PHP Authentication Header Example (using cURL)


    `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, ['Authorization: Basic ' .
    base64_encode("$username:$password")]);`

    # Searching and Sorting


    Most GET endpoints allow searching and sorting. Searches are **not**
    case-sensitive.


    ## Search


    To perform a search, add `q` as a query parameter. For example:


    `/subaccounts?q=field:value,field2:value`


    ## Order


    To perform a sort, add `order_by` as a query parameter. For example:


    `/subaccounts?order_by=field:desc/asc`


    ## AND / OR


    By default, it will search using the `AND` operator. This can be set using
    `operator` as a query parameter. For example:


    `/subaccounts?q=field:value&operator=OR`


    **Options:**


    - `AN` - returns results matching **all** query fields specified


    - `OR` - returns results matching **any** query fields specified


    ## Example


    `/subaccounts?q=first_name:john,last_name:smith&order_by=subaccount_id:asc&operator=AND`


    # CORS


    When creating your API app, specify the JavaScript (CORS) origins you'll be
    using. We use these origins to return the headers needed for CORS.


    # Date and Time


    All date/timestamps will be returned in Unix time (also known as POSIX time
    or erroneously as Epoch time) with no leap seconds.


    For example: `1435255816`


    ```

    (ISO 8601: 2015-06-25T18:10:16Z)

    ```


    More information: [Wikipedia: Unix
    time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).


    There is ony one Unix time and it is created by using the UTC/GMT time zone.
    This means you might have convert time zones to calculate timestamps. Most
    programming language have libraries to help you converting time zones.


    **The current Unix time can be found here:** [Epoch
    Converter](http://www.epochconverter.com)

        `base64`-encoded PDF file contents in the `content` field of the request
        body.

        2. An address string. In this case, submit the address in a string using
        the `address` field of the request body.

        **Supported File Types**

        We support `pdf`, `docx` and `doc` files. Contact us to add support for
        any other file type. If you're using `docx` or `doc` files, you'll need
        to convert the file first using our uploads endpoint with the
        querystring parameter `convert=post` e.g. `POST /uploads?convert=post`.
        This will return a URL to the converted pdf file that can be used in the
        `/post/letters/send` endpoint.


        **Letter File Options**


        **Use existing URL**


        With this option, you can use an existing URL to a `pdf` document. For
        example, you might generate the `pdf` on your server.


        **Upload File to Our Server**


        With this option, you can use the `/uploads` endpoint to upload the
        document. The `/uploads` endpoint returns a URL that can be used in the
        `/post/letters/send` endpoint.

      # Supported File Types


      - Supported file types are listed below. If you need to convert a file to
      a supported format, it can be first passed to our uploads endpoint:
      `/uploads?convert=fax`


      - This will return a URL to the converted pdf file that can be used in the
      /fax/send endpoint.


      - Contact us to add support for any other file type.


      ## Documents


      | File type | Required to be passed to uploads endpoint first? |

      |---|---|

      | pdf | No |

      # What is it?


      Geolocation allows you to send an SMS to a handset with a URL in the
      message. When the user taps on the URL, it sends you their location. You
      will receive the following information:


      - Latitude


      - Longitude


      - Their full address


      - A URL to a Google map with the location marked


      # How to use it


      To use Geolocation, simply insert the placeholder `(Geolocation)`
      (including the parenthesis) into an SMS or Email message, and that's it.
      Our system will handle the placeholder and insert the correct information
      required to allow geolocation tracking via message.


      For more information, see our [help
      article](https://help.clicksend.com/geolocation/how-does-geolocation-work).

      ## Send MMS Endpoint


      You can post **up to 1000 messages** with each API call. You can send to a
      mix of contacts and contact lists, as long as the total number of
      recipients is up to 1000. The response contains a status and details for
      each recipient.


      Refer to [**Application Status
      Codes**](#introduction/application-status-codes) for the possible response
      message status strings.


      # How many characters can I send in a message?


      ## Standard MMS Message


      1500 characters


      ## Unicode MMS Message


      500 characters


      If a message is longer the allowed number of characters it will be
      truncated. If a message contains any characters that aren't in the GSM
      03.38 character set, the message type will be treated as unicode.
      (`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38`)


      # Maximum File Size


      You can send a single attachment with a size of up to 250 kB. Some older
      devices can only accept attachments with up to 30 kB.


      # Supported File Types


      - Supported file types are listed below. If you need to convert a file to
      a supported format, it can be first passed to our uploads endpoint:
      `/uploads?convert=mms`


      - This will return a URL to the converted image file that can be used in
      the /mms/send endpoint.


      - Contact us to add support for any other file type.

      # How many messages can I send?


      ## Send SMS Endpoint


      You can post **up to 1000 messages** with each API call. You can send to a
      mix of contacts and contact lists, as long as the total number of
      recipients is up to 1000. The response contains a status and details for
      each recipient.


      Refer to [**Application Status
      Codes**](#introduction/application-status-codes) for the possible response
      message status strings.


      ## SMS Campaign Endpoint


      You can post to a list with **up to 20000 recipients** with each API call.
      You can only send to a single list containing up to 20,000 recipients. The
      response is far less detailed than the normal Send SMS endpoint.


      # How many characters can I send in a message?


      A standard SMS message has a maximum of 160 characters. Longer messages
      are definitely possible, however please be aware that exceeding 160
      characters will constitute a â€˜secondâ€™ message. The end user will see this
      as 1 long message on their handset.

      When a message is longer than 160 characters, this is referred to as a
      multi-part message as it contains multiple messages (or multiple-parts).
      The total SMS limit then becomes 153 characters per â€˜partâ€™ as the 7
      characters are used up by invisible headers and footers which denote which
      part of the message is being sent (i.e. Part 1 of 2). For example:

      If a message is longer than 6 message parts, it will be truncated (see
      below). If a message contains any characters that aren't in the GSM 03.38
      character set, the message type will be treated as unicode.
      (`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38`)

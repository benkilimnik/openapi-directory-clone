            A string that describes the columns (width) and rows (height) of the
            generated composed video in pixels. Defaults to `640x480`. 

            The string's format is `{width}x{height}` where: 


            * 16 <= `{width}` <= 1280

            * 16 <= `{height}` <= 1280

            * `{width}` * `{height}` <= 921,600


            Typical values are: 


            * HD = `1280x720`

            * PAL = `1024x576`

            * VGA = `640x480`

            Note that the `resolution` imposes an aspect ratio to the resulting
            composition. When the original video tracks are constrained by the
            aspect ratio, they are scaled to fit. See [Specifying Video

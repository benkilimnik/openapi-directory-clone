            When sending a Command to a SIM in text mode, we can automatically
            include the SID of the Command in the message body, which could be
            used to ensure that the device does not process the same Command
            more than once.  A value of `start` will prepend the message with
            the Command SID, and `end` will append it to the end, separating the
            Command SID from the message body with a space. The length of the
            Command SID is included in the 160 character limit so the SMS body
            must be 128 characters or less before the Command SID is included.

    <p>Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps identify potential
    resource-access risks by enabling you to identify any policies that grant
    access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning
    to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon Web Services environment.
    An external principal can be another Amazon Web Services account, a root
    user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an Amazon Web Services service,
    or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to preview and
    validate public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying
    permissions changes. This guide describes the Identity and Access Management
    Access Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically. For general
    information about IAM Access Analyzer, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">Identity
    and Access Management Access Analyzer</a> in the <b>IAM User Guide</b>.</p>
    <p>To start using IAM Access Analyzer, you first need to create an
    analyzer.</p>
